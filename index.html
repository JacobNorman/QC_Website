          <p class="text-white-50">As the world becomes increasingly digital, the need for trust and security in our computer 
            systems becomes ever more important. There is a hidden battle going on between encryption and decryption methods. 
            To maintain trust in the systems that govern so much of the world's infrastructure it is vital that encryption 
            techniques stay on top. </p>
          <p class="text-white-50">Usable quantum computers may be around very soon and present a big problem for current encryption protocols. As 
            we'll see, these methods rely on the difficulty of factorizing large numbers, a task which quantum computers could, 
            in theory, do with ease.</p>
          <p class="text-white-50">To understand how quantum cryptography works, we first need to know the basics of "classical" cryptography protocols 
            and a couple of key results from Quantum Mechanics.</p>

      <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Cryptography</h2>
      <p>The aim of cryptography is to communicate privately without a message being intercepted or changed by a third party. Let's introduce a few 
        characters to make the discussion easier. Alice has a secret message that she needs to send privately to Bob without an eavesdropper 
        - Eve - intercepting and reading the message. Eve may be a very good eavesdropper and codebreaker, so we can assume 
        that she may be able to intercept anything sent in the channel between Alice and Bob and use her code breaking skills to 
        decrypt the message if this is at all possible. To do this, Alice must alter the message (called the plaintext) in such a way 
        that Eve can't understand the message and only Bob is able to transform the encrypted message (called the ciphertext) back into the plaintext. 
        Encryption is all about finding ways of encrypting the plaintext so that it is very difficult or impossible for Eve to guess or work 
        out how to decrypt the ciphertext.</p>

              to a numerical representation which we'll call x. Then all we need to do to x to get the encrypted alphabet is add 1.</p>

            <br><br>Unfortunately, this encryption is not very secure and has a few big weaknesses: 
            <ul>
              <li> The most straightforward way to attack is simply to use trial and error. This works because there are only 25 possible values for 
                the shift, which would be extremely fast for a computer to check through.</li>
              <li>Another weakness comes from the regularity of the method; all letters are shifted by the same amount so some of the information in 
                the plaintext is preserved. For example, in the English language, letter "e" is significantly more common than any other letter, so it is 
                quite likely that the most common letter in the ciphertext represents "e" in the plaintext. If this is true, then the secret is out - the 
                codebreaker knows the value of the shift.</li>
              </ul>

        <h4 class="text-black mb-4">One-time Pad</h4>
        <p>The Caesar cypher is easy to decrypt because it's very regular- all letters are shifted by the same amount. So, what happens if 
          we shift each letter by a different, random number and how could this be done? Alice and Bob would both need to have a list of numbers (called a key 
          or one-time pad) corresponding to the shift that is applied to each letter. Then Alice would use this key to encrypt the 
          message and Bob would use the key to decrypt the message by applying the reverse shift. Below is an example of how the word "MESSAGE"
          could be encrypted using the key (one-time pad) 20100609070615.</p> 
          <img src="img/otp-example.PNG" class="OTP-size" alt="">
        <br><br><br>
        <p>In 1945, an American mathematician 
          named Claude Shannon proved that this is completely secure, provided the key is:
          <ul>
            <li>random,</li>
            <li>at least as long as the message to be encrypted,</li>
            <li>only used once,</li>
            <li>completely secret- no one else can know the key.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
          It might appear that we have found a way of sending messages completely securely. Unfortunately, we're now left with a 
          problem that is just as hard as sending the original message. For these conditions to be met, we need to send a 
          unique, random key between Alice and Bob that cannot be intercepted by Eve. To make things more difficult, this message
          must be at least as long as the message and cannot be reused. The most practical way this could be done is to deliver the 
          key in person to Alice and Bob, which quickly becomes far too expensive and time consuming.</p>
        <p>
          There are a few ways to move forward from here. The first is to scrap the idea of completely secure communication and settle
          for something that is very hard to break. Distributing keys becomes easier if the key can be reused - either repeated 
          throughout the same message or used for multiple encryptions. This is no longer secure because Shannon's conditions are no 
          longer met. Intuitively, this is because by reusing the key, we introduce regularity into the encryption which makes it possible 
          to crack.</p>
        <p>
          Then we have two more sophisticated solutions: a mathematical solution called <i>public-key encryption</i> and solution using physics 
          called <i>quantum cryptography</i>.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Public-key encryption</b> uses mathematics to create a system with two keys: one that encrypts the message and another that decrypts 
              the message. This means that the decrypting key does not need to be sent to Alice so Eve cannot intercept.
            </li>
            <li><b>Quantum cryptography</b> uses some of the weird properties of Quantum Mechanics so that Alice and Bob can send a key to each other and know for 
              sure if Eve has intercepted it or not. Then a standard protocol such as one-time pad encryption is used to send the message.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Public-Key Encryption</h2>
      <p>We've seen that one-time pad encryption works when both Alice and Bob share one secret key or one-time pad that can be used both to encrypt 
        a message and to decrypt a message. Because the same key is used for encryption and decryption, one-time pad encryption is called symmetric. 
        The key works in both directions because the encryption procedure (adding the one-time pad) and the decryption procedure (subtracting the 
        one-time pad) are both very easy to do.</p>
      <p>Public key encryption works slightly differently. Bob makes two keys using a specific process (we'll get to this later)- a public key and a private key. He sends 
        the public key to Alice and anyone else who might want to send him information but keeps the private key for himself only. The public key
        is used to encrypt the message but, unlike one-time pad encryption, the public key can't be used to decrypt the message. Only the secret 
        key can be used to decrypt the message. The following analogy is useful.</p>

              the message because only Bob has the key.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The natural question now is how would Bob make a key that was able to encrypt the plaintext but not decrypt the ciphertext? As discussed earlier, 
        encryption is just a mathematical operation (or function) that is applied to the numbers that represent the plaintext. Decryption is simply the inverse mathematical 
        operation. In the case of one-time pad encryption, encryption was done using addition and decryption by subtraction. For public-key encryption, we need to use 
        a mathematical operation that is straightforward in one direction and very difficult in the other direction. 
         </p>
      <p>It turns out there is a very simple solution to this - prime multiplication and factorisation. Computers are very efficient at multiplying numbers together, but 
        very slow at decomposing numbers into their prime factors. For example, if you were asked to calculate
        \[37 \times 41 = 1517,\]
        you could probably do this fairly quickly (or get a calculator to do it for you). But if you were asked to find the prime factors of 1247, you would have to use 
        trial and error to guess
        \[1247/2 = 623.5,\]
        \[1247/3 = 415.66,\]
        checking through all the prime numbers until you checked 29 or 43 and found
        \[1247 = 29 \times 43.\]
      This is the mathematics that RSA encryption (the most common type of Public-Key encryption) relies on. The protocol is constructed so that decrypting the message 
      requires you to know (or find) the prime factors of the public key. This means that RSA encryption can be cracked since it is possible to find the prime factors 
      of any public key. However, in practice, the public-keys are huge (around 4096-bits or 1234 digits long), so even the most advanced supercomputers can't factor 
      the public-key in a workable amount of time.

      <h2 class="text-black mb-4">Quantum Cryptography</h2>
      <h4 class="text-black mb-4">Quantum Mechanics</h4>
      <p>
        To understand how quantum cryptography works, there are a a few key concepts from quantum mechanics (QM) that must be understood.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In QM, a particle (or system) does not have a defined state (i.e. its position, momentum etc.) until it is measured. Instead, it has a <i>wavefunction</i>
            that describes the probability of the particle being in different states. When a particle is measured, we say the wavefunction "collapses" into one of the 
            possible states. <b> Note: </b> this is not the same as an observer being uncertain of the state of the particle; it really is undefined until its measured 
            and you can do experiments to show this! </li>
          <li>
            Many quantities (such as energy, position etc.) are not continuous like they are in classical mechanics. This means that they can't take any value within 
            an allowed range - only a few very special values. </li>
          <li>
            The allowed states for a particle can depend on how you measure the particle. Later, we'll be using polarized photons, where the allowed polarization  
            angles are dependent on the basis you measure in. For example, if you measure the photon in a standard x-y coordinate system, the photon can be vertically 
            polarized or horizontally polarized, but not diagonally polarized.</li>
          <li>
            In QM, the state of a particle or system is often represented using Dirac notation by |x&#10217;. So, to denote a vertically polarized photon we might use
            |&#8593;&#10217;.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Back to quantum cryptography. In the previous section, we looked at a classical cryptography method called a one-time pad that was able send a message 
        completely securely provided both Alice and Bob possess the same one-time pad and no one else knows this number. However, distributing this one-time pad secretly 
        is very difficult. So, quantum cryptography only needs to solve the key-distribution problem- the rest can be done using the one-time pad method.
      <br><br>
      <h4 class="text-black mb-4">BB84 Protocol</h4>
      <p>
        The main advantage quantum mechanical systems have for sending a key securely is that measurement fundamentally affects the particle. This means that if Eve 
        attempts to listen in and hear the key, she will alter the information in a way that Alice and Bob can detect. The first physicists to publish a method for doing 
        this were Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard, who came up with the BB84 protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Initial set-up:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Alice and Bob communicate over two channels: a classical channel (e.g. phone line, internet) and a quantum channel. We can assume Eve is able to listen in 
            to everything sent over the classical channel and she can choose to listen to information in the quantum channel (although Alice and Bob should be able to 
            detect this).</li>
          <li>
            Alice and Bob measure in two bases (or coordinate systems). One is the standard x-y axis and the other is a 45 degree rotated x-y axis.</li>
          <li>
            Polarized photons are sent over the quantum channel. Depending on the basis being used, these can take four forms: vertically polarized (|&#8593;&#10217;), horizontally  
            polarized (|&#8594;&#10217;), 45 degree polarized (|&#8599;&#10217;) and 135 degree polarized (|&#8598;&#10217;). Alice and Bob agree on the following system (shown below) to convert the 
            polarized photons into 1s and 0s (binary bits). So, if Alice wants to send a 0, she will send a horizontally  polarized (|&#8594;&#10217;) photon if she's using the 
            standard basis and an 45 degree polarized (|&#8599;&#10217;) photon if she's using the diagonal basis.</li> 
        </ul>

        Scientists have since used this protocol to send secure information and quantum cryptography is likely to be the future of cryptography. However, there are many 
        questions left to solve and more research to be done before this can be widely used. In particular, the practical implementation of these protocols is very difficult 
        due to the instability of quantum systems. This makes long distance quantum cryptography especially problematic.
